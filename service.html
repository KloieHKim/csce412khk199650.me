                <p class="muted">The RUBIES program allows upperclassmen to partner up with underclassmen to give advice, wisdom, and friendship while they adjust to college and their majors. It's a great opportunity to help them grow as individuals and in their careers.

                <p class="muted">As a neuroscience teaching assistant, I can make a direct impact on students lives and guide them through difficult courses by giving them personalized lessons and test reviews. Also, as an upperclassmen who has taken the class, I can give advice on how the professor grades and what they need to really pay attention to. 
                    This is great way to help underclassmen who are struggling in their classes to succeed and feel more confident in their abilities
                </p>
                <p class="muted">As a computer science teaching assistant, I teach students the lab material and go more in depth on concepts covered in class, showing students how to apply that knowledge in practice. I also help them by debugging code and explaining difficult subjects in relatable and more digestible ways better suited for that individual. </p>
